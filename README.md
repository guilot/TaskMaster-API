# TaskMaster-API

TaskMaster API is a project designed to enable users to create, manage, and organize tasks efficiently through a robust and intuitive API. The core functionality revolves around providing a streamlined interface for task management, empowering users to interact seamlessly with their task data.

This project is built as a learning initiative to deepen my knowledge of Go (Golang) and to refine my skills as a software developer. It serves as a practical exploration of Go's capabilities, focusing on clean architecture, performance, and scalability while adhering to best practices in API design. By developing this API, I aim to expand my expertise in backend development, database integration, and software engineering principles, paving the way for future professional growth and advanced projects.
